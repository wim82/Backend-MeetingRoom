Backend-MeetingRoom
===================

A backend which contains several RESTful webservices to manage reservations for (meeting/conference) rooms. It's written in JAVA 7, makes use of Spring, Hibernate & JodaTime frameworks. It's built on the brilliant H2 in memory database.

This project was part of a 3-week develop sprint in an extended Java/Mobile Apps course. This contains all frontend/ios code. The back-end code, which we also wrote as part of this project can be found here: https://github.com/wim82/Backend-MeetingRoom

Due to time constraints, this app is still quite buggy and contains some really ugly code. We (are/were) beginners. Explore at your own risk! :-)
